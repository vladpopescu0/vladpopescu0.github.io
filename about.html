                    What is CarYe?
                </h1> 
                <p>
                    CarYa is a car sharing application which lets people join trips all over the world.
                    It essentially functions as a carpooling service, letting you either join or be joined on trips that would've happened anyway.
                    This way the car capacity is maximized, making a better use of roads and improving traffic, as well as 
                    contributing to fighting against pollution.
                </p>

                <h1>
                    How does it work?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    After having created an account, you can start looking for trips via the homepage.
                    There you can tweak various filters, and find people who are going where you need to be, at the right time and appropriate accesibilty.
                    You can also upload the trips you regularly make (with a verified driver's profile),
                    and others can see and join in on them.
                </p>

                    About our initiative

                <p>
                    This website is made by a pair of TU Delft Computer Science and Engineering students, for their 
                    first year Database & Web Technology Course. I am now simply wrting text which serves to purpose
                    as to make the about section longer in order to display the 'sticky' property of the iamges on the right.
                    I am putting way too much effort into this :)
